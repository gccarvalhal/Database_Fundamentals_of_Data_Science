# Database Fundamentals of Data Science

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION: as indicated on the **project_description.pdf**, we’ve followed all the steps designated. 
1) **Download Files:** all the files have been successfully downloaded.

2)	**Design the Database:**
- Uml created and stored at the zip file as **uml.png**
- Relational model created and stored at the zip file as **relational.docx**
- SQL script created. **happiness.sql** file stored at the zip file

3)	**Prepare Data:** Python script (**compare-countries.py**) wrote and available at zip file. There is also a second versions with. ipynb version. Another Python code wrote to correct/remove wrong countries.

4)	**Load Data:**
  - Python script (**load_countries_of_the_world.py**) created. 
  - Python script (**load_happiness.py**) created.
(All the requirements has been attended). 

5)	**Ask Questions:**

  - Questions a) to e) asked and answered using SQL (**question.sql** file stored at zip file).
  - Extra points: Think of other interesting questions to ask. We decided to answer the following question: “WHAT ARE THE CPLP (Comunidade dos Países de Língua Portuguesa) RANK VARIATION (Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Mozambique, Portugal, Sao Tome & Principe, East Timor)?”. It’s stored as **extra_questions.sql**

6)	**Extra:**

  - We’ve created a view in postgresSQL named as **rank_cplp** to be transformed with python script.
  - We’ve used panda, matplotlib and seaborn libraries to extract information from the view, based in the extra question. It’s stored as extra.ipynb. An image of the graph (CPLP happiness per year.png) has been also stored at the same folder.
