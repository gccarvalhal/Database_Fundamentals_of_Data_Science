# Database_Fundamentals_of_Data_Science

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: as indicated on the Project file available at Moodle, we’ve followed all the steps designated. 
1)	Download Files: all the files have been successfully downloaded. 
2)	Design the Database: 
a.	Uml created and stored at the zip file as uml.png
b.	Relational model created and stored at the zip file as relational.docx
c.	SQL script created. happiness.sql file stored at the zip file
3)	Prepare Data: Python script (compare-countries.py) wrote and available at zip file. There is also a second versions with. ipynb version. Another Python code wrote to correct/remove wrong countries.
4)	Load Data:
a.	Python script (load_countries_of_the_world.py) created.

It’s stored at zip file as: Resolution\6 Extra\extra_questions.sql
6)	Extra: 
a.	We’ve created a view in postgresSQL named as rank_cplp to be transformed with python script.
b.	We’ve used panda, matplotlib and seaborn libraries to extract information from the view, based in the extra question. It’s stored at the zip file as: Resolution\6 Extra\extra.ipynb. An image of the graph (CPLP happiness per year.png) has been also stored at the same folder.
